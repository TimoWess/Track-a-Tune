ABOUT
=====
This is a macOS port of [dlrudie/Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip) written in Swift.
This program will generate a text file with the currently playing song in your documents folder

It currently only supports the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) API

IN DEVELOPMENT
=====
I'm currently working on automating the authentication process

In the future I want to support most if not all of the features that the original Snip program supports.
This includes:

* Choosing the output directory (pretty basic)
* Support for the iTunes API
* Choosing the output format of the text file
* Downloading the album artwork
