ABOUT
=====
This is a macOS port of [dlrudie/Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip) written in Swift.
This program will generate a text file in your documents folder containing the currently playing song on spotify

It currently only supports the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) API

IN DEVELOPMENT
=====
WIP:
* Output formatting support

In the future I want to support most if not all of the features that the original Snip program supports.
This includes:

* Choosing the output directory (pretty basic)
* Downloading the album artwork
* Support for the iTunes API
